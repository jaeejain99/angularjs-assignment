Statement -  Create a list of items and store in data store. A search bar is to be created based on intelligent search, which will generate the item name based on one or two alphabets. The list may have around 50 items.

Logic - A seperate .js file(dataset.js) for dataset is created. In the main file(daa.html), the alphabets entered in the input bar are matched with the words in the dataset file through ng-repeat(loop) and filter functions. All the possible matched words are displayed. Styling is added accordingly.
